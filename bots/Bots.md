Example:  mark\_for\_stop\_ec2\_resource 3h  
Note: This is meant to be used in conjunction with a more aggressive
action like stopping or termanating an instance. The first step will be
to tag an instance with the time that we want to trigger the remediation
bot.  
From there, a rule like "Instance should not have tags with \[
key='marked\_for\_stop' and value before(1, 'minutes') \]" can be ran to
check how long an instance has had the 'mark for stop' tag. Limitations:
none

THIS WORKS ACROSS ALL EC2 RELATED SERVICES:

## rds\_quarantine\_instance

What it does: Attaches the RDS instance a SG with no rules so it can't
communicate with the outside world  
Usage:  rds\_quarantine\_instance  
Limitations: Instance needs to be "Available" in order to update. If
it's in "backing up" state, this will fail  
(Might not work with Aurora since it's in a cluster)

Usage:  s3_only_allow_ssl
Note: The bot looks at the bucket policy and adds to the current policy the missing actions(s3:GetObject and s3:PutObject)
      and the SSL statement.
      if no policy in the bucket, an SSL policy will add to the bucket
Limitations: none

## sg\_delete

What it does: Deletes a security group  
Usage:  sg\_delete  
Limitations: This will fail if there is something still attached to the
SG.

##sg\_modify\_scope\_by\_port

What it does: modify Security Group's rules scope by a given port , new and old scope(optional).
Direction can be : inbound or outbound

Usage: sg_modify_scope_by_port <port> <change_scope_from|*> <change_scope_to> <direction>
 - When '*' set for replacing any rule with the specific port

Examples:
        
        sg_modify_scope_by_port 22 0.0.0.0/0 10.0.0.0/24 inbound
        sg_modify_scope_by_port 22 * 10.0.0.0/24 inbound
Notes:

    -  if the port is in a rule's port range, the bot will change the rule's ip to desire ip , to avoid that
      specify existing rule's scope instead of using '*'
    - to split the rule around the port you can use the bot : #sg_single_rule_delete

Limitations: IPv6 is not supported yet

## sg\_rules\_delete

What it does: Deletes all ingress and egress rules from a SG  
Usage:  sg\_rules\_delete  
Limitations: none


## sg_delete_not_matching_cidr
What it does: Deletes all rules on a security group , that have the given port and have a scope outside the given cidr
        * following GSL - SecurityGroup should not have inboundRules contain [ port<=x and portTo>=x and scope!= y  ]

Usage: sg_delete_not_matching_cidr <port> <cidr> <direction>

Parameters:
    port: number
    scope: a.b.c.d/e
    direction: inbound/ outbound


Example:

    sg_delete_not_matching_cidr 22 10.163.0.0/16 inbound

    *all the sg's rules with port 22 that have scope with range outside of 10.163.0.0/16 scope ,  will be deleted

Notes :

    -  before running this bot, ensure that your applications will work correctly without those rules
    - if a port is in a port range and there is a mismatch in cidr the rule will be deleted ( with all the other port in range )

Limitations: IPv6 is not supported yet



## sg_rules_delete_by_scope
What it does: Deletes all rules on a security group with a scope(cidr) containing or equal to a given scope,
             port and protocol are optional

Usage: sg_rules_delete_by_scope <scope> <direction> <port|*> <protocol|*>

Parameters:
   
    scope: a.b.c.d/e
    direction: inbound/ outbound
    port: number/ *
    protocol: TCP/ UDP/ *
    -When '*' is any value of the parameter

Examples:
    
    sg_rules_delete_by_scope 0.0.0.0/0 inbound 22 tcp

    all rules with 1.0.0.0/16 scope will be deleted for any port and protocol:
    sg_rules_delete_by_scope 1.0.0.0/16 inbound * *

    all rules with 0.0.0.0/0 scope will be deleted for port 22 and any protocol:
    sg_rules_delete_by_scope 0.0.0.0/0 inbound 22 *

Notes :
    
    - the bot deletes the rule without splitting ports ( do not create new rules without the deleted port)
      for deleting rule with split use - sg_single_rule_delete bot .
    -  before running this bot, ensure that your applications will work correctly without those rules
    - if a port is in a port range the rule wont be deleted ! use * on port parameter to delete the rule for any port
Limitations: IPv6 is not supported

## sg\_single\_rule\_delete

What it does: Deletes a single rule on a security group Usage: 
sg\_single\_rule\_delete split=\<true|false\> protocol=\<TCP|UDP\>
scope=\<a.b.c.d/e\> direction=\<inbound|outbound\> port=<number>

Example:  sg\_single\_rule\_delete split=false protocol=TCP
scope=0.0.0.0/0 direction=inbound port=22 Sample GSL: SecurityGroup
should not have inboundRules with \[scope = '0.0.0.0/0' and port\<=22
and portTo\>=22\]

Conditions and caveats: Deleting a single rule on a security group can
be difficult because the problematic port can be nested within a wider
range of ports. If SSH is open because a SG has all of TCP open, do you
want to delete the whole rule or would you break up the SG into the same
scope but port 0-21 and a second rule for 23-end of TCP port range?
Currently the way this is being addressed is using the 'split'
parameter. If it's set as false, CloudBots will only look for the
specific port in question. If it's nested within a larger port scope,
it'll be skipped. If you set split to true, then the whole rule that the
problematic port is nested in will be removed and 2 split rules will be
added in its place (ex: if port 1-30 is open and you want to remove SSH,
the new rules will be for port 1-21 and port 23-30).

If you want to delete a rule that is open on ALL ports:
Put Port 0 as the port to be deleted and the bot will remove the rule.
If you want to delete a rule that is open to ALL :
Put protocol=ALL and the bot will remove the open rule that configured with ALL as protocol
If you want to delete a rule that is open no matter to the configured protocol 
Put protocol=* and the bot will remove the open rule  
Set Split to True
 sg_single_rule_delete split=true protocol=TCP scope=8.8.8.8/32 direction=inbound port=0   

Limitations: IPv6 is not supported

## tag\_ec2\_resource

What it does: Tags an ec2 instance  
Usage:  tag\_ec2\_resource "key" "value"  
Note: Tags with spaces can be added if they are surrounded by quotes:
ex: tag\_ec2\_resource "this is my key" "this is a value"  
Limitations: none

THIS WORKS ACROSS ALL EC2 RELATED SERVICES:

  - Image
  - Instance
  - InternetGateway
  - NetworkAcl
  - NetworkInterface
  - PlacementGroup
  - RouteTable
  - SecurityGroup
  - Snapshot
  - Subnet
  - Volume
  - Vpc
  - VpcPeeringConnection

## vpc\_isolate

What it does: turn off dns resource,    
              change network acl to new empty one with deny all,  
              add iam policy, to all users in the account, which limits vpc use: ec2 and sg use in the vpc  

Usage: AUTO: vpc_isolate  
Limitation: None

## vpc\_turn\_on\_flow\_logs

What it does: Turns on flow logs for a VPC Settings: Log Group Name:
vpcFlowLogs If traffic type to be logged isn't specified, it defaults to
all. Usage:  vpc\_turn\_on\_flow\_logs
traffic\_type=\<all|accept|reject\> destination=\<logs|s3\>
s3\_arn=arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/my-logs/ Example: 
vpc\_turn\_on\_flow\_logs traffic\_type=all destination=logs Example:
 vpc\_turn\_on\_flow\_logs traffic\_type=all destination=s3
s3\_arn=arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/my-logs/

Limitations: none Sample GSL: VPC should have hasFlowLogs=true

To specify a subfolder in the bucket, use the following ARN format:
bucket\_ARN/subfolder\_name/ . For example, to specify a subfolder named
my-logs in a bucket named my-bucket , use the following ARN:
arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/my-logs/

log delivery policy name is set as: vpcFlowLogDelivery log delivery role
is set as: vpcFlowLogDelivery


# Optional Bots

These bots are not packaged with the core Lambda function because
they're extremely impactful or edge-case bots that won't be normally
used.  
If you want to use these bots, they will need to be manually added to
the function. All of the code is in the optional\_bots directory.

## ec2\_tag\_instance\_from\_vpc

### This bot was created for a customer and most likely won't be used outside of that edge case

What it does: If an instance is missing a specific tag, try to pull it
from the VPC. Usage:  ec2\_tag\_instance\_from\_vpc <Key>  
Limitations: none

## s3\_delete\_bucket

What it does: Deletes an S3 bucket  
Usage:  s3\_delete\_bucket  
Limitations: none
