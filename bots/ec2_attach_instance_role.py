## ec2_attach_instance_role
What it does: Attaches an instance role to an EC2 instance. This role needs be passed in through the params.    
Usage: AUTO: ec2_attach_instance_role role_arn=<role_arn>  

If you have a role that is the same across accounts, and don't want to pass in an account specific ARN, add '$ACCOUNT_ID' to the role ARN and the function will automatically pull in the current account ID of the finding.   
Example: AUTO: ec2_attach_instance_role role_arn=arn:aws:iam::$ACCOUNT_ID:instance-profile/ec2SSM  
Sample GSL: Instance should have roles
