'''
## Delete IGW
From the boto3 docs: The VPC must not contain any running instances with Elastic IP addresses or public IPv4 addresses.
Because of this, all instances with a public IP will be turned off in the VPC before the IGW can be detached

Limitations: 
VPCs have lots of interconnected services. This is currently just focused on EC2 but future enhancements will need to be made to turn off RDS, Redshift, etc.
